- Limit JavaDoc generation to strictly single line comments, even the comment identifiers.
  e.g. `/** This is a single line comment. */`
- Generate imperative commit messages. Make sure to append comprehensive details in the body of the
  commit message.
  e.g. `Add feature X to improve user experience` is better than `Added feature X`.
