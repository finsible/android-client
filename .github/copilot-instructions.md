- Limit JavaDoc generation to strictly single line comments, even the comment identifiers.
  e.g. `/** This is a single line comment. */`
- Generate imperative commit messages that are concise and informative followed by comprehensive
  descriptions.
  e.g. `Add feature X to improve user experience` is better than `Added feature X`.
